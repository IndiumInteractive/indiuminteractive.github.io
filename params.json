We currently have only 2 employees but the prototyping of the games is happening quick. This website is hosted on HitHub and will only ever go down when GitHub goes down, which is never... Or hardly ever. \r\n\r\n### Staff\r\nWe currently only have two team members...\r\n* @MichaelRLaws - Programmer, Artist, Designer, Founder - 2011 -\r\n* @LinkiePie - Artist, Designer, Shitty wizard - 2014 -\r\n\r\n### Games\r\nMost of our games will be published to the android and IOS platforms so that our games get \"out there*\"\r\nWe will be releasing games as standalone PC games which one day, we'll try to put on steam because games are hard to make and need to buy food.\r\n \"*out there - 10 downloads would make us happy\"\r\n\r\n### Game alphas\r\nHere will be a list of game alphas. We can not guarantee that these builds will be bug free as they will be older than what we work on.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
